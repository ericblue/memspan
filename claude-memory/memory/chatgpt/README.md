# ChatGPT Memories

Place your structured memory export here as `memories_export.md` (or `memories_export.json`).

## Files

- **`memories_export.md`** - Structured memories (generated from raw memories using `export_prompt.md`)

## Guidelines

- Structured export only; this is the file loaded by `cc-memspan --memories`
- Only include content you're comfortable loading into Claude sessions
- Large files are fine; you control when to load them

## More Information

- **Extraction instructions**: See `export-chatgpt-memories/README.md`
- **Quick start guide**: See `docs/QUICKSTART.md`
- **Usage**: Load with `cc-memspan --memories` or `make context-identity` (with memories)
